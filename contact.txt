Contact Us Page: 20 Creative Examples to Inspire You

Contact us pages are a bit undervalued in website design. Some designers save up all their creative energy for the homepage, the shop or the portfolio. While these pages are certainly the priority, the humble contact page is also worthy of attention. 


A contact page is the place where you provide information such as your email address, phone number, mailing address and location, created using a form builder. Using attractive and compelling design ideas, they draw in clients and encourage website visitors to engage with the brand. The following websites boast unique and engaging contact page examples. 


As you create a website of your own, feel free to draw inspiration from these examples when designing your contact us page.

Meria Ogawa’s contact page is not just a web design convenience; it’s also a source of connection between herself and other creatives. To reflect this idea, she uses welcoming, empathetic language. The title, for instance, is “Better Together,” rather than the usual “Contact Us.” 


In addition, the bright coral tone of the page comes as a pleasant surprise. This striking pop of color draws in the site visitors with its playfulness and warmth, and encourages people to reach out.
